        text: `'Find Your Cofeece' is a mobile Android app, made for connecting coffee-restaurants owners
        with people which work remotely, in their coffee-restaurants.
        This platfrom made for both sides. Therefore either the clients or the owners can use this app,
        and get win-win situation.
        Let me explain. Think about how much time remotely employees spend in coffee-restaurants, and now
        think about the owners - which want to give there clients good service, and on the other hand - 
        they can get more clients for there coffee-restaurants.`,

        text: `During .NET/C# course at MTA, we built a program for managing a vehicles garage.
        At this program we learned some of the important principles in OOP design and programming.
        We used OOP prinicles such as Polymorphism - which was one of the main subject of this project,
        as long with Aggregation and Encupsulation.
        Furthermore, we used Design Patterns concepts such as Bridge and Abstract Factory.
        In this project I've learned the most, as it was covered those principles and was big project.`,

        implementing HTTP and TCP protocols, using C. It was one of my comprehensive projects, which I've learned 
        basic concepts in Computers Network. With this project, I understood more about Computer Netowrk in general,
        and about HTTP/TCP in particular.
        Actually, it was one of the funnest project I did, and I figured out why the Internet is intresting.`,

        text: `On the first semester, on 2nd year of CS study at MTA - there was an OOP in C++ course.
        During this course we learned the fundamentals of OOP. We went deeply through C++ featuers and concepts, 
        which are similar to other Object-Oriented programming languages.
        Therefore, we made a final project which went through all along with the course. The project was 
        to create an Ecommerce system, and by that understand the "behind the scenes" concepts.`,
